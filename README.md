# Stickman Game Prototype

🎮 A 2D physics-based stickman game built in Python using `pymunk` and `pygame`.

🎮 A proof-of-concept 2D stickman game using realistic physics with `pymunk` and `pygame`.
This project explores ragdoll mechanics, player interaction, and physics-driven animations such as "sticky feet", mouse dragging, and jumping.

## Features
- Ragdoll stickman with realistic joints
- Keyboard and mouse control
- Physics-driven movement and interactions
- Experimental sticky feet mechanic

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Goals
✅ Standing stickman with joints
⏳ Sticky feet mechanic
⏳ Walking simulation
⏳ Jumping with arrow keys
⏳ Store/projectiles/AI
